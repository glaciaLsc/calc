# Calc: The World's Simplest Command-Line Calculator

## Purpose
GNU bc-- the standard Linux command line calculator-- is a wonderful tool,
featuring comprehensive arithmetic functionality. It is also quite beefy,
having far more complexity than what might be required for the average user.

**calc** is focused on simplicity. With this tool, users can perform
mathematical operations of varying complexity without the need for a large
program installation, and without entering an execution environment.

## Features
+ Supports prefix and postfix notation

## Coming soon...
+ Support for infix expressions
+ Exponentiation and trigonometric functionality, all provided by the good ol'
  standard libc
+ Linked list arithmetic, allowing for input / output numbers that exceed
  C-primitive size constraints
