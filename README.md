# Calc: The World's Simplest Command-Line Calculator

## Purpose
GNU bc-- the standard Linux command line calculator-- is a wonderful tool,
featuring comprehensive arithmetic functionality. It is also quite beefy,
having far more complexity than what might be required for the average user.

**calc** is focused on simplicity. With this tool, users can perform
mathematical operations of varying complexity without the need for a large
program installation, and without entering an execution environment.

## Features (coming soon)
+ Supports infix, prefix and postfix notation
